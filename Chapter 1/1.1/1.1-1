1.1-1: Describe your own real-world example that requires sorting. Describe one that requires finding the shortest distance between two points.
 Sorting Example:
Library books need to be sorted while storing, so that they can be quickly retrieved when searched by title, author, or genre.

Shortest Distance Example:
Finding the shortest route between my home and my favorite cafe using Google Maps, which applies shortest path algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s or A*.
