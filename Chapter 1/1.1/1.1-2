1.1-2: Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might you need to consider in a real-world setting?
Besides speed (time complexity), other efficiency measures include:

Space Complexity → How much memory the algorithm consumes.
Fairness → Ensuring equal resource allocation in scheduling algorithms.
Energy Efficiency → Important for battery-powered devices like smartphones.
Scalability → Ability to handle increasing data loads efficiently.
