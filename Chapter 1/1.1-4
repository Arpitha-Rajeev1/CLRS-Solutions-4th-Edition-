1.1-4: How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesperson problems similar? How are they different?
Similarities:

Both deal with graphs and finding optimal routes between points.
Both are important in logistics, navigation, and networking.

Differences:

Shortest Path Problem: Finds the shortest route between two points (solvable in polynomial time with Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm).
Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP): Finds the shortest route that visits all points exactly once and returns to the start (NP-hard, requires approximations).
