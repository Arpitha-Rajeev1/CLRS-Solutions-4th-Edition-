What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100 n^2 runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2^n on the same machine?

We want that 100 n^2 < 2^n. note that if n = 14, this becomes 100(14)2 =19600 > 214 = 16384. For n = 15 it is 100*(15)^2 = 22500 < 2^15 = 32768. So,
the answer is n = 15.
