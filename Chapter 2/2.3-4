let n = 2^k where k >= 1
For k = 1, n = 2: T(n) = n * lgn to prove, for the base case T(2) = 2 * lg(2) = 2 * 1 = 2 
Hence, base case is proved

For inductive step, T(n) = 2 * T(n/2) + n for k > 1 or n > 2
we need to prove T(n) = n * lg(n) for the inductive step as well
Let us assume, T(n/2) = (n/2) * lg(n/2) then
T(n) = 2 * (n/2) * lg(n/2) + n = n * (lgn - lg2) + n = n * lgn - n + n = n * lgn
Hence proved.
