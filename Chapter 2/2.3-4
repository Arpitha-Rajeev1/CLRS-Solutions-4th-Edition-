The while loop from line 12-18, Loop invariant is:
1. Initialization: Before the loop begins, all the elements in A are not sorted
2. Maintainance: Before each iteration, the subarray in A will contain some elements from L and R all sorted
3. Termination: Either L or R are completely copied to A in a sorted order and when the loop terminates the subarray is sorted

Other while loop will copy the rest of the elements in either L or R to the end of A, this will ensure every element is copied in a sorted order.
