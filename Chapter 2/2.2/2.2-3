Average Case Analysis
Suppose we have an array of n elements, and the target element is equally likely to be any of them.
If the element is found at index k, the algorithm performs k comparisons.
The element could be at any index 1, 2, ..., n with equal probability 1/n

Worst Case Analysis
In the worst case, the element is not in the array or is the last element. This means the algorithm checks all n elements.

Final Answer
Average-case complexity: Θ(n)
Worst-case complexity: Θ(n)

Justification
Best case: The element is the first one → Θ(1).

Worst case: The element is the last or missing → Θ(n).

Since we cannot predict where the element is located, the average number of comparisons is still Θ(n).
